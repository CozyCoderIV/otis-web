        text: "Hello There!! As you could already tell, I am Otis Jackson IV. To tell you a little more about me, I was born and raised in Fort Worth, Texas. How did I get here? Well, alongside my journey as a freelance artist and author I turned out to be a pretty solid scholar in academics. I wanted to find a good career path that could benefit my niche of artistic skills, but also be looked upon with respect amongst my friends, family, and peers. With softawre engineering runningn through my family, I decided to become a software developer !!",

        text: "Growing up in the DFW (Dallas Fort Worth) area, for majority of my childhood I was placed in the Duncanville ISD school program. I was always enthusiastic about schoolwork and grades which landed me in the GATE (gifted and talented program). In early 2016, my family and I moved from Dallas to Aledo, Texas near Weatherford. At Aledo High School, I was introduced to better opportunities. My junior year, I dual enrolled with Weatherford College to where by 2020 I'd have 24 total hours of college credit. I'm now an active enrolled junior CSC major at Louisiana State University",

        text: "If you wanna dig a bit deeper into what Otis is really like, this is the right place. What I love to do in my free time away from being a devoted software developer consist of three main things;( Anime, Gym, & StoryBoarding ). Just like everyone else, I have minor escapes from life. I love shonen anime because It plays a key part in how I approach things in life today. One Piece is my favorite shonen as of now. I love going to the gym to keep my physical body in shape due to prior experience with powerlifing and football at Aledo Highschool. I love writing stories which I recently found as a new passion of mines.",

In the next 5 years, I want to be an established fullstack engineer able to efficiently and effectively work backend alongside front end applications. ",
